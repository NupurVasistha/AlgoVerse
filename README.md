  3. [Sudoku]



**GREEDY PARADIGM**
  1. [Kruskals]
  2. [Fractional Knapsack]
  3. [Huffman Coding]


  **DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING PARADIGM**  
  1. Unbounded 0/1 Knapsack
  2. 0/1 Knapsack


## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used
**AlgoVerse** is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML** 
- **CSS** 
- **JAVASCRIPT**

[🚀To the respected TAs, I understand that React or other libraries are often mandatory, but I chose to use JavaScript alone to ensure a lightweight, dependency-free implementation, focusing on core logic and performance optimization. Or we can say, I just want to test myself to see if I am good at JavaScript or not—if I know JavaScript well, I'll be able to do React well. In the future, I'll update it to React. 🐣✨]


## 💻 How to Run This Project  
### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**  
Open your terminal and run:
